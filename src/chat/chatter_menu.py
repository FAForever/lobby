    # and the its 'parent's' class and so on. As a result it is hard to
    # extract any of them from the chain of 'builds' without modifying
    # lots of chat-related files.
    # It's better to avoid passing the whole bunch of dependencies arguments
    # into a single build and wonder which of them are needed for this
    # particular class and which are for its dependencies.
    # Many of those build methods (if not all) were created just for the
    # purpose of passing additional unexpected arguments, so that __init__
    # doesn't complain about them. (see 9b14d4e7)
    # Maybe it's fine in some cases, but chat's build chain is very convoluted
    # and hard to grasp
